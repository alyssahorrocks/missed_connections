# Missed Connections

#### This group project was created after learning Ruby. It keeps track of search keywords and returns missed connection articles to a user. {9/3/2015}

##### By Alyssa Horrocks, Austin Kincaid, Jessica Joly, & Jennifer Bell

## Description

Users can sign up with their name and e-mail. They can log into missed connections and create keywords to search missed connections. When the search is run, it will return useable links that match their user-specific keywords. Users can view the body text and visit the source material if desired. Ideally, it would run on a server constantly, update the list of connections, and notify the user when new connections appear based on their keywords.

We based our scraping methods on the Viking Code School's tutorial here (#thanks): http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/web-scraping-craigslist-with-rubys-mechanize-gem

## Setup

This application uses Ruby, Sinatra, Nokogiri gem, Bootstrap, and Mechanize gem.

* `git clone https://github.com/ahorrocks2/missed_connections.git`
* `rake db:create`
* `rake db:schema:load`
* `rake db:test:prepare`
* start Sinatra with ruby app.rb
* Enjoy!
